Prevent invisible project images from loading when page loads, since they add ~360 KiB to every uncached load
  None of following stop images from being requested by browser:
    Setting "display: none" or "visibility: hidden" on img elements
    Setting "display: none" on div parent of img elements
    Calling $('img').removeAttr('src') on $(document).load, as per Lazy Load Plugin (http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload)
Namespace JS
Prevent caching when DEBUG = True

Design:
  Extend "about" vertical border
  Blog section
  Ensure header is right-aligned
  Text shadows on headers
  Place border around project image viewport
