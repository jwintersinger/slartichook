Prevent invisible project images from loading when page loads, since they add ~360 KiB to every uncached load
  None of following stop images from being requested by browser:
    Setting "display: none" or "visibility: hidden" on img elements
    Setting "display: none" on div parent of img elements
    Calling $('img').removeAttr('src') on $(document).ready, as per Lazy Load Plugin (http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload)

Design:
  Extend "about" vertical border
  Blog section
  Place border around project image viewport

Blog:
  Investigate fetching of posts on index -- are all objects fetched to produce paginatd list of posts?
  Store author of posts
  Tag cloud
  Comments
  Authoring tool
  Page-specific page titles
  Add blog to homepage
